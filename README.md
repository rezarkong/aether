# AETHER

This repository is a software implementation of the paper AETHER: An Ultra-High Throughput and Low Energy Authenticated Encryption Scheme.

`./ref` is edited from https://github.com/qantik/aether.

`Checker.cpp` was created by me using SSE instructions.

Both implementations do not match the test vectors in the paper, but I have been unable to find the bug.
