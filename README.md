# AETHER

This repository is a software implementation of the paper AETHER: An Ultra-High Throughput and Low Energy Authenticated Encryption Scheme.

`./ref` is edited from https://github.com/qantik/aether.

`Checker.cpp` was created by myself using SSE instructions.

Both implementations **do not** match the test vectors in the paper.
